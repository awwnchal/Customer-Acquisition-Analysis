roject Title: Customer Acquisition Analysis for Game Fun: Evaluating the Impact of Digital Advertising

# Project Description:

This individual project focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of a digital advertising campaign conducted by Game Fun, a leading developer of casual mobile games. The goal of the campaign was to improve customer acquisition by running an A/B experiment using online display banners. The project involves performing a comprehensive data analysis, evaluating the impact of the experiment on various customer segments, and providing recommendations based on the findings.

The project begins by examining the data provided in the "GameFun.xls" file, which contains anonymized customer information, including demographics, website visited, advertising impressions, and purchase behavior. The data analysis is carried out using tools such as Excel, R, or Python, depending on the preference of the analyst.

# The key questions addressed in this project include:

Evaluating Probabilistic Equivalence:

a. Comparing the averages of income, gender, and gamer variables between the test and control groups and assessing their statistical significance.

b. Interpreting the metrics to understand the probabilistic equivalence of the test and control groups.

c. Discussing the actions to be taken if a large difference between the groups is observed prior to the experiment.

d. Proposing appropriate significance tests for analyzing "big data" scenarios with millions of consumers.


Assessing Purchase Rates:

a. Comparing the average purchase rates between the test and control groups for all customers.

b. Analyzing purchase rates for different customer segments, including male vs. female customers and gamers vs. non-gamers.

c. Evaluating purchase rates for female gamers vs. male gamers.

Evaluating Expected Revenue:

a. Assessing the expected revenue in the test and control groups for all customers.

b. Analyzing the expected revenue for female gamers vs. male gamers.

# Providing Recommendations:
Based on the analysis and findings from previous sections, summarizing the expected financial outcome for Game Fun and making a recommendation to the management team.

a. Recommending whether Game Fun should run the promotion again in the future.

b. Suggesting whether the promotion should be offered to all customers or a targeted segment.

This project aims to showcase strong data analytics skills, including statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and interpreting the results to provide actionable recommendations. The use of real-world data and practical scenarios from the mobile gaming industry enhances the relevance and applicability of the project.
